## 📈 Sprint Progress: v0.3.0-rc

### ✅ Completed Features

#### 1. **Post-Onboarding Finalization System**
- **Finish Setup Card**: Appears after family creation or when accessing `/familyprofile` with incomplete setup
- **Dynamic Dyad Toggles**: Enable/Disable buttons for all 3 dyads (Night Helper, Tantrum Translator, Meal Mood Companion)
- **Consent Management**: Modal consent flows with localized text from `dyads.yaml`
- **AI Toggle**: Cloud reasoning opt-in/opt-out with consent tracking
- **State Persistence**: All choices saved to family profile (`enabled_dyads`, `consents`, `cloud_reasoning`)

#### 2. **Dyad Launch System** 
- **Unified Architecture**: All dyad callbacks consolidated under `fs:` prefix and `finish_setup_router`
- **JWT Token Generation**: Secure 10-minute session tokens with family/dyad context
- **PWA Deep Linking**: Correct URL generation with proper dyad ID mapping
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works with GitHub Pages deployment (`purplewarren.github.io`)

#### 3. **Bot Infrastructure Improvements**
- **Process Management**: Robust `scripts/bot_manager.py` preventing Telegram conflicts
- **Middleware Fixes**: Proper callback routing with `GateMiddleware` allowing finish-setup flows
- **Error Handling**: Safe callback acknowledgment preventing UI freezes
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Full audit trail for all user actions and system events

#### 4. **AI Integration (20B Model)**
- **Model Enforcement**: `gpt-oss:20b` enforced on staging as requested
- **Default Off**: `REASONER_DEFAULT_ON=0` implementing "AI off by default" strategy
- **Explicit Opt-in**: Users must explicitly consent to enable cloud reasoning
- **Status Reflection**: `/reason_status` and `/reason_model` reflect user choices

### 🔧 Technical Fixes Implemented

#### **Critical Issue Resolution**
1. **Callback Routing**: Fixed middleware intercepting button clicks
2. **Token Generation**: Corrected API calls to `generate_session_token`
3. **PWA URL Mapping**: Fixed dyad ID mismatch (`meal_mood` → `meal`)
4. **Process Conflicts**: Eliminated multiple bot instance Telegram conflicts
5. **Consent Flow**: Fixed text rendering and button responsiveness

#### **Data Model Enhancements**
- Added `consents: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]` to `FamilyProfile`
- Enhanced family data validation and error handling
- Implemented proper async/sync method usage
- Added structured event logging for compliance

## 🧪 Quality Assurance Status

### ✅ **Fully Tested & Working**
- **Onboarding Flow**: Complete family creation wizard (7 steps)
- **Finish Setup**: All dyad toggles and AI opt-in functional
- **Dyad Launching**: All 3 dyads route to correct PWA interfaces
- **Consent Management**: Accept/decline flows with proper persistence
- **Bot Commands**: `/familyprofile`, `/summondyad`, `/reasoning` all functional
- **Process Management**: Clean startup/shutdown without conflicts

### 📊 **Test Results**
```
✅ Family Creation: PASS (7/7 steps complete)
✅ Dyad Enablement: PASS (3/3 dyads working)
✅ PWA Launches: PASS (correct routing confirmed)
✅ AI Opt-in: PASS (consent flow working)
✅ Data Persistence: PASS (all settings saved)
✅ Bot Management: PASS (no conflicts detected)
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### **Bot Components**
- **`handlers_onboarding.py`**: 7-step family creation FSM
- **`handlers_finish_setup.py`**: Post-onboarding dyad/AI configuration
- **`handlers_commands.py`**: Core commands (`/familyprofile`, `/summondyad`)
- **`gate_middleware.py`**: User flow gating with finish-setup bypass
- **`dyad_registry.py`**: Dyad metadata and JWT session management

### **Data Flow**
```
User → Onboarding (7 steps) → Finish Setup → Dyad Launch → PWA
  ↓           ↓                    ↓              ↓         ↓
Profile   Family Data         Consents      JWT Token   Session
```

### **Security & Privacy**
- **JWT Tokens**: 10-minute expiry, family/dyad scoped
- **Consent Tracking**: Granular per-dyad consent with timestamps
- **Local Processing**: PWA handles audio locally (no raw data transmission)
- **AI Opt-in**: Explicit user consent required for cloud reasoning

---

## 🚀 Deployment Status

### **Current Environment**
- **Bot**: Running on staging with `gpt-oss:20b` model
- **PWA**: Deployed to `purplewarren.github.io/silli-meter`
- **Database**: Local JSON files with proper validation
- **Logs**: Comprehensive structured logging in `logs/bot.log`

### **Configuration**
```bash
PWA_HOST=purplewarren.github.io
PWA_PATH=/silli-meter
REASONER_DEFAULT_ON=0  # AI off by default
MODEL_PREFERENCE=gpt-oss:20b  # 20B model enforced
```
