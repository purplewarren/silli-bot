# Staging Deploy & Validation Report
**Date**: August 7, 2025  
**Version**: v0.3.0-alpha  
**Environment**: Docker Compose Staging  

## ✅ Infrastructure Status
- **Docker Compose**: All 4 services running (bot, reasoner, ollama, nginx)
- **Network**: Internal container networking functional
- **Volumes**: Data persistence configured
- **Ports**: 80, 443, 5001, 8000, 11434 exposed correctly

## ✅ Service Health
| Service | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| silli-bot-staging | ✅ Running | Telegram bot service |
| silli-reasoner-staging | ✅ Running | AI reasoning service |
| silli-ollama-staging | ✅ Running | llama3.2:1b model loaded |
| silli-nginx-staging | ✅ Running | Reverse proxy |

## ✅ Performance Metrics
### Reasoner Smoke Test Results:
- **Tantrum Test**: ✅ PASS (9.8s latency)
- **Meal Test**: ✅ PASS (12.6s latency) 
- **Cache Hit Test**: ✅ PASS (2ms cache hit)
- **Overall**: ✅ FUNCTIONAL

### Key Performance Notes:
- **Model Switch**: Changed from llama3.2:3b to llama3.2:1b due to CPU overload
- **CPU Usage**: Reduced from 1275% to manageable levels
- **Response Time**: ~10-12s for AI generation, <10ms for cache hits
- **Cache**: Working correctly, significant performance improvement

## 🔧 Issues Resolved
1. **Flask Dependency**: Added flask==3.0.0 to requirements.txt
2. **Environment Variables**: Fixed OLLAMA_HOST configuration 
3. **Model Performance**: Switched to lighter 1B model for staging
4. **Docker Networking**: Container-to-container communication working

## ⚠️ Staging Limitations
- **Model Quality**: llama3.2:1b provides basic functionality but lower quality than production models
- **Resource Constraints**: Staging environment limited to lighter models
- **No SSL**: Using self-signed certificates for HTTPS

## 📋 Next Steps
1. **Pilot Testing**: Deploy to limited user group
2. **Feedback Collection**: Gather CSAT scores
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Track real-world usage
4. **GO/NO-GO Decision**: Based on pilot results

## 🎯 Deployment Status: ✅ READY FOR PILOT
The staging environment is functional and ready for limited pilot testing with the understanding that AI responses will be basic quality due to the lighter model constraints.
